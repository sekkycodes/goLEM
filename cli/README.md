## TODOs

* Design a CLI for handling golems
  * Spinning up new golems
  * Check status, and retrieve other informations about active nodes
  * Print out a (very simple) visual representation of information flow
* Let the CLI discover all golem nodes that are active in the network on startup (or by command)
* Have the CLI have a way to send out configuration changes to all golems (or to some specifically)
  * How I imagine it could look like:     
    * config [...] id1,id2
    * config [...] all
